# Instructions for collecting results

Run inside the folder *bash_scripts*: <br>

```setup
./results_all_batched.sh
./results_processing_on_local.sh
```

For the first command, it might be useful to generate an equivalent script that sends paralllel jobs in a cluster. <br>
The main results are created in the folder *merged_dataset_results* and *figures_for_paper*
